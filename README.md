# Process Mining Library

This is a library used to demonstrate the applications of process mining from scratch. I am aware of libraries such as Pm4Py which already implements most of the functionality seen here. As I said the intention of this library is to demonstrate in plain python code how to implement process mining.

There are also some packages that I aim to extend such that they can add unique value to process mining analyses: 

* In particular the predict package is something I will try to build out such that it isn't just demonstrative but also useful and unique. This will include event log encoders for feature generation, classification techniques for predicting case traces and predicting throughput times.

* The event log package will also eventually have novel applications. These include classes to find and remedy data quality patterns and statistical analyses to identify outliers.
